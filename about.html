        Hi, im Synth. Im a <span id="dynamicAge"></span> year old, amateur
        and aspiring developer from North East England. I had began my
        developing journey around November of 2022, making simple python
        scripts, and in early December I created my first website, quickly
        followed along by many, many more simple webistes building my
        skills in HTML and CSS. At this point I decide I wanted to step
        up my development to the next level, so I turn to javascript.
        I spend a month or so learning javascript. I was now confident at
        creating any website from scratch. I then continued learning new
        skills like, AutoHotKey & Lua. I also became much stronger at
        my base skill, frontend development.</br>
        </br>
        After this, my first large project was client work for a
        friend of mine. I was tasked with creating a fully responsive,
        photography blog website. You can find the finished product at
        [<a href="https://surf-pics.com"><u>surf-pics.com</u></a>].
